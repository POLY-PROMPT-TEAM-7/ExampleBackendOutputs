The final 'thing' does not need to be physical, but there must be something to represent the 'thing'. We will do the first trade in class and switch with your teammate the following week. Each teammate must do at least 3 trades and end up with an item with a value of at least $10.</p>\n<p>You will utilize: Prospecting, rejection, elevator pitch, storytelling, persuasion, strategy, negotiation, teamwork, communication, feature/benefits, and closing.</p>\n<p>Submission/Class Presentation - On Presentation Day, your group will present your Trail of Trades ending with your final biggest and best 'thing' to the class. To help with your presentation, submit a PDF to Canvas before class for me to pull up for your group. For your presentation, walk us through the Trail of Trades, one trade at a time, with each slide showing a picture of the 'thing', the team member making the deal, and its value. Last, give us a brief reflection on 2 take-aways from this project. The class will vote on a category winner for <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">each</span> of these categories:&nbsp; size, value, and creativity.</p>\n<p>Canvas Submission - In Canvas, only 1 person from your group needs to submit your team PDF. Please submit it before Thursday's class so I can pull up your submission for your presentation in class. Otherwise, it officially needs to be submitted by midnight on Friday.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><em>Rubric:</em>&nbsp;</span> Each group will get full credit for participating but both students need to present the Trail of Trades.&nbsp;</p><script src=\"https://instructure-uploads-pdx.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/account_152790000000000001/attachments/19401205/dp_app.js\"></script>",
